# markstrap
Frontend mobile-friendly framework for websites

HTML:

All styles and scripts are tested within the "style_tests" folder. All tests can be accessed on the "all_tests.html" page. These tests also act as a template - HTML can be copied/pasted from these tests into actual webpages.

CSS:

SASS is used to separate the styles into more manageable files and then compile them into a single CSS file. All styles are responsive (tested down to iPhone 5 screen size) and compatible with modern browsers (tested on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, and Edge as of 2018).

Javascript:

Majority of scripts are written with jQuery. Some styles and functionality will not work if Javascript is not enabled.

Images:

The images included in the "style_tests" folder are used for test purposes only. I do not own these images.
